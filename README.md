# Hi there, I'm Jorge! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jorge Lopez Gamarra and I'm passionate about technology and programming. I studied engineering and learned how to program from robots to web pages. I specialise in front-end development, machine learning and automation. And I'm currently learning Express.js and TensorFlow2.0.
